## Unsolved problems and hurdles

I had a lot of trouble with the CSS chickens mostly because I wasn't careful enough and accidently made a copy of two heads on each chicken. This caused all kinds of problems with my code and changing colors. I also spent way to long trying to change and animate my chickens which made me run out of time. I'm a little dissapointed I didn't make many of my stretch goals and I need to learn how to plan my time better.
